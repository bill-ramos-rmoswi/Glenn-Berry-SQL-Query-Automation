-- MEMORYCLERK_SQLBUFFERPOOL was new for SQL Server 2012. It should be your highest consumer of memory

-- CACHESTORE_SQLCP  SQL Plans         
-- These are cached SQL statements or batches that aren't in stored procedures, functions and triggers
-- Watch out for high values for CACHESTORE_SQLCP
-- Enabling 'optimize for ad hoc workloads' at the instance level can help reduce this
-- Running DBCC FREESYSTEMCACHE ('SQL Plans'); periodically may be required to better control this

-- CACHESTORE_OBJCP  Object Plans      
-- These are compiled plans for stored procedures, functions and triggers

-- If you see very high usage by MEMORYCLERK_SQLLOGPOOL
-- SQL Server 2017 CU23 added a new command, DBCC FREESYSTEMCACHE ('LogPool');
