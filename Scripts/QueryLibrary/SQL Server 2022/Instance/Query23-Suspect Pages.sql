-- Look at Suspect Pages table (Query 23) (Suspect Pages)
SELECT DB_NAME(sp.database_id) AS [Database Name], 
       sp.[file_id], sp.page_id, sp.event_type, 
	   sp.error_count, sp.last_update_date,
	   mf.[name] AS [Logical Name], mf.physical_name AS [File Path]

-- event_type value descriptions
-- 1 = 823 error caused by an operating system CRC error
--     or 824 error other than a bad checksum or a torn page (for example, a bad page ID)
-- 2 = Bad checksum
-- 3 = Torn page
-- 4 = Restored (The page was restored after it was marked bad)
-- 5 = Repaired (DBCC repaired the page)
-- 7 = Deallocated by DBCC

-- Ideally, this query returns no results. The table is limited to 1000 rows.
-- If you do get results here, you should do further investigation to determine the root cause
